# Benchmark Summary

This file contains benchmark results for LLM Config Manager.

## Overview

LLM Config Manager provides a comprehensive benchmark suite that measures:

- **Configuration Operations**: Get, set, list, merge, and override resolution
- **Secret Management**: Encryption and decryption of sensitive values
- **Cache Performance**: L1 (in-memory) and L2 (disk-backed) cache operations
- **Cryptographic Operations**: AES-256-GCM encryption, decryption, and key generation
- **Storage Operations**: Atomic file writes, reads, and directory listings

## Running Benchmarks

Use the CLI to run benchmarks:

```bash
# Run all benchmarks
llm-config run --all

# Run benchmarks by category
llm-config run --category config
llm-config run --category cache
llm-config run --category crypto

# Run a specific benchmark
llm-config run --target config_get
```
